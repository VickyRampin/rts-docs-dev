It does, however, leverage autoscaling. This means that if the cluster hasn't been used for a while, it might take a while for resources to become available (typically 3-5 minutes) as nodes are turned on and NodeManagers register with YARN. During this time, the following warning message will appear and indicate that the cluster is at capacity and resources are not available:  WARN org.apache.spark.scheduler.cluster.YarnScheduler: Initial job has not accepted any resources; check your cluster UI to ensure that workers are registered and have sufficient resources   This warning will go away after new nodes have been added by autoscaling and more resources are available for YARN applications. If it does not go away after more than 10 minutes, please contact the HPC team. Autoscaling is actively monitored, but a duration of more than 10 minutes may indicate a failure of Dataproc's monitoring infrastructure.  Currently, NYU Dataproc's autoscaling is configured so that the cluster will have between 3 and 43 nodes depending upon demand.

These chunks are then converted to embeddings and stored in a vector database (which specializes in storing and retrieving vectors). This setup allows us now &quot;retrieve&quot; the required context for an incoming prompt before it is sent to an LLM. The &quot;retrieval&quot; phase consists of converting the prompt to an embedding and looking up embeddings for chunks of the document that are similar to it. The text chunks associated with the embeddings similar to the embedding for the query are then added as additional context to the prompt before passing it to an LLM. The LLM now has the associated context it needs to generate an relevant response to the prompt. Here's a link to a script to test this out yourself, once you have API access to an embedding model and an LLM: https://github.com/NYU-RTS/rts-docs-examples/tree/main/genai/rag .

You can download and run Docker on your own computer with any operating system and build containers with ease while Singularity is used in a more academic setting. Singularity only supports Linux operating systems and cannot run on a Windows Linux Kernel (your Windows Ubuntu), so it is much more limited.However, Docker requires root or admin access for the operating system it deploys on, and our clusters do not offer that access to any software that requires this criteria. Thus Docker is not available on the clusters and Singularity is.A silver lining in all of this is that Singularity fully supports Docker images and you can do everything in Docker and push your image to Docker Hub and pull them on the clusters. Thus making sure that you don't need to relearn Singularity all over again and can just use it through the simplest of commands in this wiki.  Good luck with Singularity, and have fun!

You can browse available images to see available options:  ls /share/apps/overlay-fs-ext3   In this example we use overlay-15GB-500K.ext3.gz as it has enough available storage for most conda environments. It has 15GB free space inside and is able to hold 500K files You can use another size as needed.  cp -rp /share/apps/overlay-fs-ext3/overlay-15GB-500K.ext3.gz . gunzip overlay-15GB-500K.ext3.gz   Choose a corresponding Singularity image. For this example we will use the following image:  /share/apps/images/cuda12.1.1-cudnn8.9.0-devel-ubuntu22.04.2.sif   For Singularity image available on nyu HPC Torch, please check the singularity images folder:  ls /share/apps/images/   For the most recent supported versions of PyTorch, please check the PyTorch website.  Launch the appropriate Singularity container in read/write mode (with the :rw flag):  singularity exec --fakeroot --overlay overlay-15GB-500K.ext3:rw /share/apps/images/cuda12.1.1-cudnn8.9.0-devel-ubuntu22.04.2.sif /bin/bash   The above starts a bash shell inside the referenced Singularity Container overlaid with the 15GB 500K you set up earlier. This creates the functional illusion of having a writable filesystem inside the typically read-only Singularity container.  note Please note that the default Singularity on Torch is now Apptainer, which requires the --fakeroot option to load overlay files in read/write mode.  Now, inside the container, download and install miniforge to /ext3/miniforge3.  note Please note your prompt should indicate you're in singularity with the Singularity&gt; prompt  wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh bash Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p /ext3/miniforge3 # rm Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh # if you don't need this file any longer   Next, create a wrapper script /ext3/env.sh using a text editor, like nano:  touch /ext3/env.sh nano /ext3/env.sh   The wrapper script will activate your conda environment, to which you will be installing your packages and dependencies. The script should contain the following:  #!/bin/bash unset -f which source /ext3/miniforge3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh export PATH=/ext3/miniforge3/bin:$PATH export PYTHONPATH=/ext3/miniforge3/bin:$PATH   Activate your conda environment with the following:  source /ext3/env.sh   If you have the &quot;defaults&quot; channel enabled, please disable it with:  conda config --remove channels defaults   Now that your environment is activated, you can update and install packages:  conda update -n base conda -y conda clean --all --yes conda install pip -y conda install ipykernel -y # Note: ipykernel is required to run as a kernel in the Open OnDemand Jupyter Notebooks   To confirm that your environment is appropriately referencing your Miniforge installation, try out the following:  unset -f which which conda # output: /ext3/miniforge3/bin/conda which python # output: /ext3/miniforge3/bin/python python --version # output: Python 3.12.10 which pip # output: /ext3/miniforge3/bin/pip exit # exit Singularity   Install packages​  You may now install packages into the environment with either the pip install or conda install commands.  warning The login nodes restrict memory to 2GB per user, which may cause some large packages to crash. In addition, on Torch, the login nodes and compute nodes run different operating system versions. This means that code built on the login nodes probably won't run on the compute nodes. For these reasons, please start an interactive job with adequate compute and memory resources to install packages: srun --cpus-per-task=2 --mem=10GB --time=04:00:00 --pty /bin/bash # wait to be assigned a node After it is running, you’ll be redirected to a compute node. From there, run singularity to setup on conda environment, same as you were doing on login node. Your prompt should look similar to this: # Your prompt should now look something like this once your jobs starts: [NetID@cm001 pytorch-example]$ singularity exec --fakeroot --overlay overlay-15GB-500K.ext3:rw /share/apps/images/cuda12.1.1-cudnn8.9.0-devel-ubuntu22.04.2.sif /bin/bash source /ext3/env.sh [NetID@cm001 pytorch-example]$ Then you can activate your environment: singularity exec --fakeroot --overlay overlay-15GB-500K.ext3:rw /share/apps/images/cuda12.1.1-cudnn8.9.0-devel-ubuntu22.04.2.sif /bin/bash # Singularity&gt; # activate the environment source /ext3/env.sh   We will install PyTorch as an example:  pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116 pip3 install jupyter jupyterhub pandas matplotlib scipy scikit-learn scikit-image Pillow   For the latest versions of PyTorch please check the PyTorch website.  You can see the available space left on your image with the following commands:  find /ext3 | wc -l # output: should be something like: 77674 du -sh /ext3 # output should be something like: 6.5G /ext3   Now, exit the Singularity container and then rename the overlay image. Typing exit and hitting enter will exit the Singularity container if you are currently inside it. You can tell if you're in a Singularity container because your prompt will be different, such as showing the prompt Singularity&gt;:  #Singularity&gt; exit mv overlay-15GB-500K.ext3 my_pytorch.ext3   Test your PyTorch Singularity Image​  singularity exec --overlay /scratch/&lt;NetID&gt;/pytorch-example/my_pytorch.ext3:ro /share/apps/images/cuda12.1.1-cudnn8.9.0-devel-ubuntu22.04.2.sif /bin/bash -c 'source /ext3/env.sh; python -c &quot;import torch; print(torch.__file__); print(torch.__version__)&quot;' #output: /ext3/miniforge3/lib/python3.8/site-packages/torch/__init__.py #output: 2.7.1+cu126   note the end :ro addition at the end of the pytorch ext3 image starts the image in read-only mode.

You will not be able to open it from a new process. Once the overlay is opened either in read-write or read-only mode, it cannot be opened in RW mode from other processes either. For production jobs to run, the overlay image should be open in read-only mode. You can run many jobs at the same time as long as they are run in read-only mode.

To help facilitate this we have created this section that will provide examples of how one might use our resources for ML and AI tasks. For ML we'll cover two prominent open-source deep learning frameworks, PyTorch and TensorFlow. We'll show how to start with a single GPU example and then show more sophisticated examples. For AI we'll cover how to run a Hugging Face Large Language Model (LLM) and how to fine tune an LLM. Specifically, we provide guides on: LLM Inference: Use the standard Hugging Face transformers library for basic tasks, and also introduce vLLM, a high-throughput serving engine that offers faster inference and an OpenAI-compatible API. vLLM CLI: We provide examples of using the vllm command-line tool to quickly serve models and engage in interactive chat sessions. Fine-tuning LLMs: We provide a practical example of fine-tuning the Gemma model to follow specific instructions. This section compares the original model with our improved version, showing how to achieve better response quality on Torch.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"vLLM - A Command Line LLM Tool","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/hpc/ml_ai_hpc/LLM Inference/vLLM/","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"What is vLLM?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"vLLM - A Command Line LLM Tool","url":"/docs/hpc/ml_ai_hpc/LLM Inference/vLLM/#what-is-vllm","content":" vLLM is a fast and easy-to-use library for LLM inference and serving.

Qubits can be in superposition states and can be entangled. This allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations exponentially faster than classical computers for specific problems like factoring large numbers and simulating quantum systems.   Our LoRA Fine-tuned Model (Gemma-3-4B-PT + LoRA on Guanaco):​  Great question! Let me break down quantum computing in simple terms: **Think of it like this**: Regular computers use bits that are either 0 or 1 (like light switches that are either ON or OFF). Quantum computers use &quot;quantum bits&quot; or &quot;qubits&quot; that can be 0, 1, or both at the same time - imagine a coin that's spinning in the air, being both heads and tails until it lands. **Why this matters**: This allows quantum computers to: - Try many solutions to a problem simultaneously - Solve certain types of problems much faster than regular computers - Handle complex calculations that would take classical computers thousands of years **Real applications**: Password breaking, drug discovery, weather prediction, and financial modeling.   The fine-tuned model provides clearer explanations with better structure, analogies, and practical context!  Official Instruction-tuned Model (google/gemma-3-4b-it):​  Quantum computing is a revolutionary approach to computation that leverages quantum mechanics principles. Here's a beginner-friendly explanation: **Basic Concept**: While classical computers use bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits) that can exist in multiple states simultaneously through &quot;superposition.&quot; **Key Advantages**: - Parallel processing of multiple possibilities - Exponential speedup for specific problem types - Superior performance in cryptography, optimization, and simulation **Current Applications**: Drug discovery, financial modeling, cryptography, and artificial intelligence research.   This comparison demonstrates how our custom fine-tuning can achieve similar or better instruction-following capabilities compared to the official instruction-tuned variant.    tip Complete scripts used are available here: https://github.com/NYU-RTS/rts-docs-examples/tree/main/hpc/llm_fine_tuning  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"System Environment Setup​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Fine tune LLMs on HPC","url":"/docs/hpc/ml_ai_hpc/llm_fine_tuning/#system-environment-setup","content":" ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Singularity Container & Overlay Configuration​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Fine tune LLMs on HPC","url":"/docs/hpc/ml_ai_hpc/llm_fine_tuning/#singularity-container--overlay-configuration","content":" Component\tConfigurationSingularity Image\t/scratch/work/public/singularity/cuda11.2.2-cudnn8-devel-ubuntu20.04.sif Overlay\tCreated using singularity overlay create --size 25000 overlay-25GB-conda.ext3 Conda Path\t/ext3/miniconda3 within overlay Singularity Shell Command\tSee below  singularity shell --nv \\ --overlay /scratch/&lt;NetID&gt;/fine-tune/overlay-25GB-conda.ext3:rw \\ /scratch/work/public/singularity/cuda11.2.2-cudnn8-devel-ubuntu20.04.sif   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Python Environment and Dependency Installation​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Fine tune LLMs on HPC","url":"/docs/hpc/ml_ai_hpc/llm_fine_tuning/#python-environment-and-dependency-installation","content":" bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p /ext3/miniconda3 source /ext3/miniconda3/bin/activate pip install torch transformers datasets accelerate peft trl   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Model Cache Configuration for Hugging Face​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Fine tune LLMs on HPC","url":"/docs/hpc/ml_ai_hpc/llm_fine_tuning/#model-cache-configuration-for-hugging-face","content":" To avoid exceeding home directory quotas during large model downloads:  export HF_HOME=/scratch/&lt;NetID&gt;/.cache/huggingface   Ensure this is set both interactively and within sbatch scripts.

There are several types of quota limits, such as limits on the amount of disk space (disk quota), number of files (inode quota) etc. The default user quota limits on HPC file systems are listed on our Data Management page.  Home directory inode quotas One of the common issues users report is running out of inodes in their home directory. This usually occurs during software installation, for example installing conda environment under their home directory. Running out of quota causes a variety of issues such as running user jobs being interrupted or users being unable to finish the installation of packages under their home directory.  Users can check their current utilization of quota using the myquota command. The myquota command provides a report of the current quota limits on mounted file systems, the user's quota utilization, as well as the percentage of quota utilization.  In the following example the user who executes the myquota command is out of inodes in their home directory.

That’s because, by convention, variables that are also available to use by other programs are given upper-case names. Such variables are called environment variables as they are shell variables that are defined for the current shell and are inherited by any child shells or processes.  To create an environment variable you need to export a shell variable. For example, to make our SECRET_IDENTITY available to other programs that we call from our shell we can do:  $ SECRET_IDENTITY=Camilla $ export SECRET_IDENTITY   You can also create and export the variable in a single step:  $ export SECRET_IDENTITY=Camilla   Using environment variables to change program behaviour Set a shell variable TIME_STYLE to have a value of iso and check this value using the echo command. Now, run the command ls with the option -l (which gives a long format). export the variable and rerun the ls -l command. Do you notice any difference? [Click for Solution] Solution The TIME_STYLE variable is not seen by ls until is exported, at which point it is used by ls to decide what date format to use when presenting the timestamp of files.  You can see the complete set of environment variables in your current shell session with the command env (which returns a subset of what the command set gave us). The complete set of environment variables is called your runtime environment and can affect the behaviour of the programs you run.  Job environment variables When Slurm runs a job, it sets a number of environment variables for the job. One of these will let us check what directory our job script was submitted from. The SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR variable is set to the directory from which our job was submitted. Using the SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR variable, modify your job so that it prints out the location from which the job was submitted.

In this case, the convention is to use a colon ‘:’ as a separator. If a program wants the individual elements of such a list, it’s the program’s responsibility to split the variable’s string value into pieces.  Let’s have a closer look at that PATH variable. Its value defines the shell’s search path for executables, i.e., the list of directories that the shell looks in for runnable programs when you type in a program name without specifying what directory it is in.  For example, when we type a command like analyze, the shell needs to decide whether to run ./analyze or /bin/analyze. The rule it uses is simple: the shell checks each directory in the PATH variable in turn, looking for a program with the requested name in that directory. As soon as it finds a match, it stops searching and runs the program.  To show how this works, here are the components of PATH listed one per line:  /share/apps/singularity/bin /share/apps/local/bin /home/NetID/.local/bin /home/NetID/bin /share/apps/singularity/bin /share/apps/local/bin /usr/local/bin /usr/bin /usr/local/sbin /usr/sbin /usr/lpp/mmfs/bin /opt/slurm/bin   On our computer, there are actually three programs called analyze in three different directories: /bin/analyze, /usr/local/bin/analyze, and /users/NetID/analyze. Since the shell searches the directories in the order they’re listed in PATH, it finds /bin/analyze first and runs that. Notice that it will never find the program /users/NetID/analyze unless we type in the full path to the program, since the directory /users/NetID isn’t in PATH.  This means that I can have executables in lots of different places as long as I remember that I need to update my PATH so that my shell can find them.  What if I want to run two different versions of the same program? Since they share the same name, if I add them both to my PATH the first one found will always win. In the next episode we’ll learn how to use helper tools to help us manage our runtime environment to make that possible without us needing to do a lot of bookkeeping on what the value of PATH (and other important environment variables) is or should be.

The discovered packages are then installed into the project library with the renv::hydrate() function, which will also attempt to save time by copying packages from your user library (rather than reinstalling from CRAN) as appropriate.  Calling renv::init() will also write out the infrastructure necessary to automatically load and use the private library for new R sessions launched from the project root directory.

[Click for Solution] Solution You would likely see something more like this: [user@laptop ~]$ ls Applications Documents Library Music Public Desktop Downloads Movies Pictures The remote computer’s home directory shares almost nothing in common with the local computer: they are completely separate systems!  Most high-performance computing systems run the Linux operating system, which is built around the UNIX Filesystem Hierarchy Standard. Instead of having a separate root for each hard drive or storage medium, all files and devices are anchored to the “root” directory, which is /:  [NetID@log-1 ~]$ ls / afs bin@ dev gpfs lib@ media mnt opt root sbin@ share state tmp var archive boot etc home lib64@ misc net proc run scratch srv sys usr vast   The /home/NetID, /scratch/NetID, /archive/NetID, and /vast/NetID directories are created for you by default and they are where you'll probably store most of your files, but there are other options as well. Please see the tip below and our storage documentation for details about how these directories differ, as well as other storage options available. Other folders on a UNIX OS contain system files and change as you install new software or upgrade your OS.  Using the HPC filesystems On Geene, you have a number of places where you can store your files. These differ in both the amount of space allocated and whether or not they are backed up. Home – data stored here is available throughout the HPC system, and often backed up periodically. Please note the limit on the number of files (inodes) which can get used up easily. Use the myquota command to ensure that you are not running out of inodes!Scratch – used for temporary file storage while running jobs. It is not backed up and files that are unused for over 60 days are purged. It should not be used for long term storage.Vast – flash-drive based system that is optimal for workloads with high I/O rates. Like the scratch storage, it is also not backed up and files that are unused for over 60 days are purged.Research Project Space (RPS) – provides data storage space for research projects that is easily shared amongst collaborators, backed up, and not subject to the old file purging policy. Note that it is a paid service.Archive – provides a space for long-term storage of research output. It is only accessible from the login nodes, so it is inaccessible by running jobs.

On a cluster, there are different types of nodes for different types of tasks. The node where you are right now is called the login node, head node, landing pad, or submit node. A login node serves as an access point to the cluster.  As a gateway, the login node should not be used for time-consuming or resource-intensive tasks. It is well suited for uploading and downloading small files, setting up software, and running tests. Generally speaking, in these lessons, we will avoid running jobs on the login node.  Who else is logged in to the login node?  [NYUNetID@log-1 ~]$ who   This may show only your user ID, but there are likely several other people (including fellow learners) connected right now.  Dedicated Transfer Nodes If you want to transfer larger amounts of data to or from the cluster, Torch offers dedicated nodes for data transfers only. The motivation for this lies in the fact that larger data transfers should not obstruct operation of the login node for anybody else. As a rule of thumb, consider all transfers of a volume larger than 500 MB to 1 GB as large. But these numbers change, e.g., depending on the network connection of yourself and of your cluster or other factors.  The real work on a cluster gets done by the compute (or worker) nodes. compute nodes come in many shapes and sizes, but generally are dedicated to long or hard tasks that require a lot of computational resources.  All interaction with the compute nodes is handled by a specialized piece of software called a scheduler (the scheduler used in this lesson is called Slurm). We’ll learn more about how to use the scheduler to submit jobs next, but for now, it can also tell us more information about the compute nodes.  For example, we can view all of the compute nodes by running the command sinfo.

CPUs are a computer’s tool for actually running programs and calculations. Information about a current task is stored in the computer’s memory. Disk refers to all storage that can be accessed like a file system. This is generally storage that can hold data permanently, i.e. data is still there even if the computer has been restarted. While this storage can be local (a hard drive installed inside of it), it is more common for nodes to connect to a shared, remote fileserver or cluster of servers.    Explore Your Computer Try to find out the number of CPUs and amount of memory available on your personal computer. Note that, if you’re logged in to the remote computer cluster, you need to log out first. To do so, type Ctrl+d or exit: [NYUNetID@log-1 ~]$ exit [user@laptop ~]$ [Click for Solution] Solution There are several ways to do this. Most operating systems have a graphical system monitor, like the Windows Task Manager. More detailed information can be found on the command line: Run system utilities: [user@laptop ~]$ nproc --all [user@laptop ~]$ free -m Read from /proc: [user@laptop ~]$ cat /proc/cpuinfo [user@laptop ~]$ cat /proc/meminfo Run system monitor [user@laptop ~]$ htop   Explore the Login Node Now compare the resources of your computer with those of the login node. [Click for Solution] Solution [user@laptop ~]$ ssh NetID@login.torch.hpc.nyu.edu [NetID@log-1 ~]$ nproc --all [NetID@log-1 ~]$ free -m You can get more information about the processors using lscpu, and a lot of detail about the memory by reading the file /proc/meminfo: [NetID@log-1 ~]$ less /proc/meminfo You can also explore the available filesystems using df to show disk free space. The -h flag renders the sizes in a human-friendly format, i.e., GB instead of B. The type flag -T shows what kind of filesystem each resource is. [NYUNetID@log-1 ~]$ df -Th Different results from df The local filesystems (ext, tmp, xfs, zfs) will depend on whether you’re on the same login node (or compute node, later on).Networked filesystems (beegfs, cifs, gpfs, nfs, pvfs) will be similar – but may include NetID, depending on how it is mounted. Shared Filesystems This is an important point to remember: files saved on one node (computer) are often available everywhere on the cluster!  Explore a Worker Node Finally, let’s look at the resources available on the worker nodes where your jobs will actually run. Try running this command to see the name, CPUs and memory available on a worker node: sinfo --node cs012 -o &quot;%n %c %m&quot;   Compare Your Computer, the Login Node and the Compute Node Compare your laptop’s number of processors and memory with the numbers you see on the cluster login node and compute node. What implications do you think the differences might have on running your research work on the different systems and nodes? [Click for Solution] Solution Compute nodes have substantially more memory (RAM) installed than a personal computer. More, faster memory is key for large or complex numerical tasks.  Differences Between Nodes Many HPC clusters have a variety of nodes optimized for particular workloads. Some nodes may have larger amount of memory, or specialized resources such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs or “video cards”).  With all of this in mind, we will now cover how to talk to the cluster’s scheduler, and use it to start running our scripts and programs!  Key Points An HPC system is a set of networked machines.HPC systems typically provide login nodes and a set of compute nodes.The resources found on independent (worker) nodes can vary in volume and type (amount of RAM, processor architecture, availability of network mounted filesystems, etc.).Files saved on shared storage are available on all nodes.The login node is a shared machine: be considerate of other users.

Both of these use similar syntax and the concepts are the same so learning to use one will allow you to use whichever is installed on the system you are using.

[NetID@log-1 ~]$ which R /usr/bin/which: no R in (share/apps/singularity/bin: /share/apps/local/bin: /home/yourUsername/.local/bin: /home/yourUsername/bin: /share/apps/singularity/bin: /share/apps/local/bin: /usr/local/bin: /usr/bin: /usr/local/sbin: /usr/sbin: /usr/lpp/mmfs/bin: /opt/slurm/bin:)   We can load the R command with module load:  [NetID@log-1 ~]$ module load r/gcc/4.4.0 [NetID@log-1 ~]$ which R /share/apps/r/4.4.0/gcc/bin/R   So, what just happened?  To understand the output, first we need to understand the nature of the $PATH environment variable. $PATH is a special environment variable that controls where a UNIX system looks for software. Specifically $PATH is a list of directories (separated by :) that the OS searches through for a command before giving up and telling us it can’t find it. As with all environment variables we can print it out using echo.  [NetID@log-1 ~]$ echo $PATH /share/apps/r/4.4.0/gcc/bin: /share/apps/singularity/bin: /share/apps/local/bin: /home/yourUsername/.local/bin: /home/yourUsername/bin: /usr/local/bin: /usr/bin: /usr/local/sbin: /usr/sbin: /usr/lpp/mmfs/bin: /opt/slurm/bin:   You’ll notice a similarity to the output of the which command. In this case, there’s only one difference: the different directory at the beginning. When we ran the module load command, it added a directory to the beginning of our $PATH. Let’s examine what’s there:  [NetID@log-1 ~]$ ls /share/apps/r/4.4.0/gcc/bin R Rscript __run_base.bash   Taking this to its conclusion, module load will add software to your $PATH. It “loads” software. A special note on this - depending on which version of the module program that is installed at your site, module load will also load required software dependencies.  Let's see an example of this when loading the module lammps/openmpi/intel/20231214:  To start, let’s use module list. module list shows all loaded software modules.  [NetID@log-1 ~]$ module list No modules loaded [NetID@log-1 ~]$ module load lammps/openmpi/intel/20231214 [NetID@log-1 ~]$ module list Currently Loaded Modules: 1) szip/intel/2.1.1 5) gsl/intel/2.6 9) python/intel/3.8.6 2) hdf5/intel/1.12.0 6) openmpi/intel/4.0.5 10) boost/intel/1.74.0 3) netcdf-c/intel/4.7.4 7) fftw/openmpi/intel/3.3.9 11) plumed/openmpi/intel/2.8.3 4) pnetcdf/openmpi/intel/1.12.1 8) intel/19.1.2 12) lammps/openmpi/intel/20231214   So in this case, loading the lammps module (a molecular dynamics software package), also loaded 11 other modules as well. Let’s try unloading the lammps package.  [NetID@log-1 ~]$ module unload lammps/openmpi/intel/20231214 [NetID@log-1 ~]$ module list No modules loaded   So using module unload “un-loads” a module along with its dependencies. If we wanted to unload everything at once, we could run module purge (unloads everything).  [NetID@log-1 ~]$ module purge No modules loaded   note This module loading process happens principally through the manipulation of environment variables like $PATH. There is usually little or no data transfer involved.  The module loading process manipulates other special environment variables as well, including variables that influence where the system looks for software libraries, and sometimes variables which tell commercial software packages where to find license servers.  The module command also restores these shell environment variables to their previous state when a module is unloaded.

What is MPI? The Message Passing Interface is a set of tools which allow multiple tasks running simultaneously to communicate with each other. Typically, a single executable is run multiple times, possibly on different machines, and the MPI tools are used to inform each instance of the executable about its sibling processes, and which instance it is. MPI also provides tools to allow communication between instances to coordinate work, exchange information about elements of the task, or to transfer data. An MPI instance typically has its own copy of all the local variables.  While MPI-aware executables can generally be run as stand-alone programs, in order for them to run in parallel they must use an MPI run-time environment, which is a specific implementation of the MPI standard. To activate the MPI environment, the program should be started via a command such as mpiexec (or mpirun, or srun, etc. depending on the MPI run-time you need to use), which will ensure that the appropriate run-time support for parallelism is included.  MPI Runtime Arguments On their own, commands such as mpiexec can take many arguments specifying how many machines will participate in the execution, and you might need these if you would like to run an MPI program on your own (for example, on your laptop). In the context of a queuing system, however, it is frequently the case that MPI run-time will obtain the necessary parameters from the queuing system, by examining the environment variables set when the job is launched.  Let’s modify the job script to request more cores and use the MPI run-time.

The parallel job received 4× more processors than the serial job: does that mean it finished in ¼ the time? [Click for Solution] Solution The parallel job did take less time: 11 seconds is better than 30! But it is only a 2.7× improvement, not 4×. Look at the job output: While “process 0” did serial work, processes 1 through 3 did their parallel work.While process 0 caught up on its parallel work, the rest did nothing at all. Process 0 always has to finish its serial task before it can start on the parallel work. This sets a lower limit on the amount of time this job will take, no matter how many cores you throw at it. This is the basic principle behind Amdahl’s Law, which is one way of predicting improvements in execution time for a fixed workload that can be subdivided and run in parallel to some extent.

As we have just seen, real programs need some time for the MPI processes to communicate and coordinate, and some types of calculations can’t be subdivided: they only run effectively on a single CPU.  Additionally, if the MPI processes operate on different physical CPUs in the computer, or across multiple compute nodes, even more time is required for communication than it takes when all processes operate on a single CPU.  In practice, it’s common to evaluate the parallelism of an MPI program by:  running the program across a range of CPU countsrecording the execution time on each runcomparing each execution time to the time when using a single CPU  Since “more is better” – improvement is easier to interpret from increases in some quantity than decreases – comparisons are made using the speedup factor S, which is calculated as the single-CPU execution time divided by the multi-CPU execution time. For a perfectly parallel program, a plot of the speedup S versus the number of CPUs n would give a straight line, S = n.  Let’s run one more job, so we can see how close to a straight line our amdahl code gets.

Total execution time (according to rank 0): 7.697 seconds   Non-Linear Output When we ran the job with 4 parallel workers, the serial job wrote its output first, then the parallel processes wrote their output, with process 0 coming in first and last. With 8 workers, this is not the case: since the parallel workers take less time than the serial work, it is hard to say which process will write its output first, except that it will not be process 0!  Now, let’s summarize the amount of time it took each job to run:  Number of CPUs\tRuntime (sec)1\t30.033 4\t10.888 8\t7.697  Then, use the first row to compute speedups S, using Python as a command-line calculator:  [NetID@log-1 amdahl]$ for n in 30.033 10.888 7.697; do python3 -c &quot;print(30.033 / $n)&quot;; done   Number of CPUs\tSpeedup\tIdeal1\t1.0\t1 4\t2.75\t4 8\t3.90\t8  The job output files have been telling us that this program is performing 85% of its work in parallel, leaving 15% to run in serial. This seems reasonably high, but our quick study of speedup shows that in order to get a 4× speedup, we have to use 8 or 9 processors in parallel. In real programs, the speedup factor is influenced by  CPU designcommunication network between compute nodesMPI library implementationsdetails of the MPI program itself  Using Amdahl’s Law, you can prove that with this program, it is impossible to reach 8× speedup, no matter how many processors you have on hand. We'll discuss estimating job resources more in the next tutorial Using Resources Effectively.  In an HPC environment, we try to reduce the execution time for all types of jobs, and MPI is an extremely common way to combine dozens, hundreds, or thousands of CPUs into solving a single problem.

Our shell script will have three parts:  On the very first line, add #!/bin/bash. The #! (pronounced “hash-bang” or “shebang”) tells the computer what program is meant to process the contents of this file. In this case, we are telling it that the commands that follow are written for the command-line shell (what we’ve been doing everything in so far).Anywhere below the first line, we’ll add an echo command with a friendly greeting. When run, the shell script will print whatever comes after echo in the terminal. echo -n will print everything that follows, without ending the line by printing the new-line character.

Comments in UNIX shell scripts (denoted by #) are typically ignored, but there are exceptions. For instance the special #! comment at the beginning of scripts specifies what program should be used to run it (you’ll typically see #!/usr/bin/env bash).

One thing that is absolutely critical when working on an HPC system is specifying the resources required to run a job. This allows the scheduler to find the right time and place to schedule our job. If you do not specify requirements (such as the amount of time you need), you will likely be stuck with your site’s default resources, which is probably not what you want.  The following are several key resource requests:  --ntasks=&lt;ntasks&gt; or -n &lt;ntasks&gt;: How many CPU cores does your job need, in total?--time &lt;days-hours:minutes:seconds&gt; or -t &lt;days-hours:minutes:seconds&gt;: How much real-world time (walltime) will your job take to run? The &lt;days&gt; part can be omitted.--mem=&lt;megabytes&gt;: How much memory on a node does your job need in megabytes? You can also specify gigabytes using by adding a little g afterwards (example: --mem=5g)--nodes=&lt;nnodes&gt; or -N &lt;nnodes&gt;: How many separate machines does your job need to run on? Note that if you set ntasks to a number greater than what one machine can offer, Slurm will set this value automatically.  note Just requesting these resources does not make your job run faster, nor does it necessarily mean that you will consume all of these resources. It only means that these are made available to you. Your job may end up using less memory, or less time, or fewer nodes than you have requested, and it will still run.  It’s best if your requests accurately reflect your job’s requirements. We’ll talk more about how to make sure that you’re using resources effectively in a later episode of this lesson.  Submitting Resource Requests Modify our hostname script so that it runs for a minute, then submit a job for it on the cluster.

Resource requests are typically binding. If you exceed them, your job will be killed. Let’s use wall time as an example. We will request 1 minute of wall time, and attempt to run a job for two minutes.

Although this appears harsh, this is actually a feature. Strict adherence to resource requests allows the scheduler to find the best possible place for your jobs. Even more importantly, it ensures that another user cannot use more resources than they’ve been given. If another user messes up and accidentally attempts to use all of the cores or memory on a node, Slurm will either restrain their job to the requested resources or kill the job outright. Other jobs on the node will be unaffected. This means that one user cannot mess up the experience of others, the only jobs affected by a mistake in scheduling will be their own.

Slurm also provides the ability to start an interactive session.  There are very frequently tasks that need to be done interactively. Creating an entire job script might be overkill, but the amount of resources required is too much for a login node to handle. A good example of this might be building a genome index for alignment with a tool like HISAT2. Fortunately, we can run these types of tasks as a one-off with srun.  srun runs a single command on the cluster and then exits. Let’s demonstrate this by running the hostname command with srun. (We can cancel an srun job with Ctrl-c.)   srun hostname gra752   srun accepts all of the same options as sbatch. However, instead of specifying these in a script, these options are specified on the command-line when starting a job.

Note that the prompt will likely change to reflect your new location, in this case the compute node we are logged onto. You can also verify this with hostname.  Creating remote graphics To see graphical output inside your jobs, you need to use X11 forwarding. To connect with this feature enabled, use the -Y option when you login with ssh with the command ssh -Y username@host. To demonstrate what happens when you create a graphics window on the remote node, use gnuplot as shown in the following example after you have created your ssh session with X11 forwarding: [NetID@log-1 ~]$ srun --x11 -c4 -t2:00:00 --mem=4000 --pty /bin/bash [NetID@cm034 ~]$ module load gnuplot/gcc/5.4.1 [NetID@cm034 ~]$ gnuplot gnuplot&gt; test If X11 forwarding is working you will see a test plot window open.

There is an overhead to transferring each individual file and when we are transferring large numbers of files these overheads combine to slow down our transfers to a large degree.  The solution to this problem is to archive multiple files into smaller numbers of larger files before we transfer the data to improve our transfer efficiency. Sometimes we will combine archiving with compression to reduce the amount of data we have to transfer and so speed up the transfer. The most common archiving command you will use on a (Linux) HPC cluster is tar.  tar can be used to combine files and folders into a single archive file and, optionally, compress the result. Let’s look at the file we downloaded from the lesson site, amdahl.tar.gz.  The .gz part stands for gzip, which is a compression library. It’s common (but not necessary!) that this kind of file can be interpreted by reading its name: it appears somebody took files and folders relating to something called “amdahl,” wrapped them all up into a single file with tar, then compressed that archive with gzip to save space.  Let’s see if that is the case, without unpacking the file. tar prints the “table of contents” with the -t flag, for the file specified with the -f flag followed by the filename. Note that you can concatenate the two flags: writing -t -f is interchangeable with writing -tf together. However, the argument following -f must be a filename, so writing -ft will not work.  [user@laptop ~]$ tar -tf amdahl.tar.gz hpc-carpentry-amdahl-46c9b4b/ hpc-carpentry-amdahl-46c9b4b/.github/ hpc-carpentry-amdahl-46c9b4b/.github/workflows/ hpc-carpentry-amdahl-46c9b4b/.github/workflows/python-publish.yml hpc-carpentry-amdahl-46c9b4b/.gitignore hpc-carpentry-amdahl-46c9b4b/LICENSE hpc-carpentry-amdahl-46c9b4b/README.md hpc-carpentry-amdahl-46c9b4b/amdahl/ hpc-carpentry-amdahl-46c9b4b/amdahl/__init__.py hpc-carpentry-amdahl-46c9b4b/amdahl/__main__.py hpc-carpentry-amdahl-46c9b4b/amdahl/amdahl.py hpc-carpentry-amdahl-46c9b4b/requirements.txt hpc-carpentry-amdahl-46c9b4b/setup.py   This example output shows a folder which contains a few files, where 46c9b4b is an 8-character git commit hash that will change when the source material is updated.  Now let’s unpack the archive. We’ll run tar with a few common flags:  -x to extract the archive-v for verbose output-z for gzip compression-f «tarball» for the file to be unpacked  Extract the Archive Using the flags above, unpack the source code tarball into a new directory named “amdahl” using tar. [user@laptop ~]$ tar -xvzf amdahl.tar.gz hpc-carpentry-amdahl-46c9b4b/ hpc-carpentry-amdahl-46c9b4b/.github/ hpc-carpentry-amdahl-46c9b4b/.github/workflows/ hpc-carpentry-amdahl-46c9b4b/.github/workflows/python-publish.yml hpc-carpentry-amdahl-46c9b4b/.gitignore hpc-carpentry-amdahl-46c9b4b/LICENSE hpc-carpentry-amdahl-46c9b4b/README.md hpc-carpentry-amdahl-46c9b4b/amdahl/ hpc-carpentry-amdahl-46c9b4b/amdahl/__init__.py hpc-carpentry-amdahl-46c9b4b/amdahl/__main__.py hpc-carpentry-amdahl-46c9b4b/amdahl/amdahl.py hpc-carpentry-amdahl-46c9b4b/requirements.txt hpc-carpentry-amdahl-46c9b4b/setup.py Note that we did not need to type out -x -v -z -f, thanks to flag concatenation, though the command works identically either way – so long as the concatenated list ends with f, because the next string must specify the name of the file to extract.  The folder has an unfortunate name, so let’s change that to something more convenient.  [user@laptop ~]$ mv hpc-carpentry-amdahl-46c9b4b amdahl   Check the size of the extracted directory and compare to the compressed file size, using du for “disk usage”.  [user@laptop ~]$ du -sh amdahl.tar.gz 8.0K amdahl.tar.gz [user@laptop ~]$ du -sh amdahl 48K amdahl   Text files (including Python source code) compress nicely: the “tarball” is one-sixth the total size of the raw data!  If you want to reverse the process – compressing raw data instead of extracting it – set a c flag instead of x, set the archive filename, then provide a directory to compress:  [user@laptop ~]$ tar -cvzf compressed_code.tar.gz amdahl amdahl/ amdahl/.github/ amdahl/.github/workflows/ amdahl/.github/workflows/python-publish.yml amdahl/.gitignore amdahl/LICENSE amdahl/README.md amdahl/amdahl/ amdahl/amdahl/__init__.py amdahl/amdahl/__main__.py amdahl/amdahl/amdahl.py amdahl/requirements.txt amdahl/setup.py   If you give amdahl.tar.gz as the filename in the above command, tar will update the existing tarball with any changes you made to the files. That would mean adding the new amdahl folder to the existing folder (hpc-carpentry-amdahl-46c9b4b) inside the tarball, doubling the size of the archive!  Working with Windows When you transfer text files from a Windows system to a Unix system (Mac, Linux, BSD, Solaris, etc.) this can cause problems. Windows encodes its files slightly different than Unix, and adds an extra character to every line. On a Unix system, every line in a file ends with a \\n (newline). On Windows, every line in a file ends with a \\r\\n (carriage return + newline). This causes problems sometimes. Though most modern programming languages and software handles this correctly, in some rare instances, you may run into an issue. The solution is to convert a file from Windows to Unix encoding with the dos2unix command. You can identify if a file has Windows line endings with cat -A filename. A file with Windows line endings will have ^M$ at the end of every line. A file with Unix line endings will have $ at the end of a line. To convert the file, just run dos2unix filename. (Conversely, to convert back to Windows format, you can run unix2dos filename.)

The syntax can be a little complex for new users, but we’ll break it down. The scp command is a relative of the ssh command we used to access the system, and can use the same public-key authentication mechanism.  To upload to another computer, the template command is  [user@laptop ~]$ scp local_file NetID@login.torch.hpc.nyu.edu:remote_destination   in which @ and : are field separators and remote_destination is a path relative to your remote home directory, or a new filename if you wish to change it, or both a relative path and a new filename. If you don’t have a specific folder in mind you can omit the remote_destination and the file will be copied to your home directory on the remote computer (with its original name). If you include a remote_destination, note that scp interprets this the same way cp does when making local copies: if it exists and is a folder, the file is copied inside the folder; if it exists and is a file, the file is overwritten with the contents of local_file; if it does not exist, it is assumed to be a destination filename for local_file.

[user@laptop ~]$ scp -r amdahl NetID@login.torch.hpc.nyu.edu:   Caution For a large directory – either in size or number of files – copying with -r can take a long time to complete.  When using scp, you may have noticed that a : always follows the remote computer name. A string after the : specifies the remote directory you wish to transfer the file or folder to, including a new name if you wish to rename the remote material. If you leave this field blank, scp defaults to your home directory and the name of the local material to be transferred.  On Linux computers, / is the separator in file or directory paths. A path starting with a / is called absolute, since there can be nothing above the root /. A path that does not start with / is called relative, since it is not anchored to the root.  If you want to upload a file to a location inside your home directory – which is often the case – then you don’t need a leading /. After the :, you can type the destination path relative to your home directory. If your home directory is the destination, you can leave the destination field blank, or type ~ – the shorthand for your home directory – for completeness.  With scp, a trailing slash on the target directory is optional, and has no effect. A trailing slash on a source directory is important for other commands, like rsync.  A Note on rsync As you gain experience with transferring files, you may find the scp command limiting. The rsync utility provides advanced features for file transfer and is typically faster compared to both scp and sftp (see below). It is especially useful for transferring large and/or many files and for synchronizing folder contents between computers. The syntax is similar to scp. To transfer to another computer with commonly used options: [user@laptop ~]$ rsync -avP amdahl.tar.gz NetID@login.torch.hpc.nyu.edu: The options are: -a (archive) to preserve file timestamps, permissions, and folders, among other things; implies recursion-v (verbose) to get verbose output to help monitor the transfer-P (partial/progress) to preserve partially transferred files in case of an interruption and also displays the progress of the transfer. To recursively copy a directory, we can use the same options: [user@laptop ~]$ rsync -avP amdahl NetID@login.torch.hpc.nyu.edu:~/ As written, this will place the local directory and its contents under your home directory on the remote system. If a trailing slash is added to the source, a new directory corresponding to the transferred directory will not be created, and the contents of the source directory will be copied directly into the destination directory. To download a file, we simply change the source and destination: [user@laptop ~]$ rsync -avP NetID@login.torch.hpc.nyu.edu:amdahl ./   File transfers using both scp and rsync use SSH to encrypt data sent through the network. So, if you can connect via SSH, you will be able to transfer files. By default, SSH uses network port 22. If a custom SSH port is in use, you will have to specify it using the appropriate flag, often -p, -P, or --port. Check --help or the man page if you’re unsure.  Change the Rsync Port Say we have to connect rsync through port 768 instead of 22. How would we modify this command?

The components between your data’s source and destination have varying levels of performance, and in particular, may have different capabilities with respect to bandwidth and latency.  Bandwidth is generally the raw amount of data per unit time a device is capable of transmitting or receiving. It’s a common and generally well-understood metric.  Latency is a bit more subtle. For data transfers, it may be thought of as the amount of time it takes to get data out of storage and into a transmittable form. Latency issues are the reason it’s advisable to execute data transfers by moving a small number of large files, rather than the converse.  Some of the key components and their associated issues are:  Disk speed: File systems on HPC systems are often highly parallel, consisting of a very large number of high performance disk drives. This allows them to support a very high data bandwidth. Unless the remote system has a similar parallel file system you may find your transfer speed limited by disk performance at that end.Meta-data performance: Meta-data operations such as opening and closing files or listing the owner or size of a file are much less parallel than read/write operations. If your data consists of a very large number of small files you may find your transfer speed is limited by meta-data operations. Meta-data operations performed by other users of the system can also interact strongly with those you perform so reducing the number of such operations you use (by combining multiple files into a single file) may reduce variability in your transfer rates and increase transfer speeds.Network speed: Data transfer performance can be limited by network speed. More importantly it is limited by the slowest section of the network between source and destination. If you are transferring to your laptop/workstation, this is likely to be its connection (either via LAN or WiFi).Firewall speed: Most modern networks are protected by some form of firewall that filters out malicious traffic. This filtering has some overhead and can result in a reduction in data transfer performance. The needs of a general purpose network that hosts email/web-servers and desktop machines are quite different from a research network that needs to support high volume data transfers. If you are trying to transfer data to or from a host on a general purpose network you may find the firewall for that network will limit the transfer rate you can achieve.  As mentioned above, if you have related data that consists of a large number of small files it is strongly recommended to pack the files into a larger archive file for long term storage and transfer. A single large file makes more efficient use of the file system and is easier to move, copy and transfer because significantly fewer metadata operations are required. Archive files can be created using tools like tar and zip. We have already met tar when we talked about data transfer earlier.  Schematic diagram of bandwidth and latency for disk and network I/O. Each of the components on the figure is connected by a blue line of width proportional to the interface bandwidth. The small mazes at the link points illustrate the latency of the link, with more tortuous mazes indicating higher latency.  Consider the Best Way to Transfer Data If you are transferring large amounts of data you will need to think about what may affect your transfer performance. It is always useful to run some tests that you can use to extrapolate how long it will take to transfer your data. Say you have a “data” folder containing 10,000 or so files, a healthy mix of small and large ASCII and binary data. Which of the following would be the best way to transfer them to Torch? [user@laptop ~]$ scp -r data NYUNetID@login.torch.hpc.nyu.edu:~/ [user@laptop ~]$ rsync -ra data NYUNetID@login.torch.hpc.nyu.edu:~/ [user@laptop ~]$ rsync -raz data NYUNetID@login.torch.hpc.nyu.edu:~/ [user@laptop ~]$ tar -cvf data.tar data [user@laptop ~]$ rsync -raz data.tar NYUNetID@login.torch.hpc.nyu.edu:~/ [user@laptop ~]$ tar -cvzf data.tar.gz data [user@laptop ~]$ rsync -ra data.tar.gz NYUNetID@login.torch.hpc.nyu.edu:~/ [Click for Solution] Solution scp will recursively copy the directory. This works, but without compression.rsync -ra works like scp -r, but preserves file information like creation times. This is marginally better.rsync -raz adds compression, which will save some bandwidth. If you have a strong CPU at both ends of the line, and you’re on a slow network, this is a good choice.This command first uses tar to merge everything into a single file, then rsync -z to transfer it with compression. If you have a large number of files, metadata overhead can hamper your transfer, so this is a good idea.This command uses tar -z to compress the archive, then rsync to transfer it. This may perform similarly to the command directly above, but in most cases (for large datasets), it’s the best combination of high throughput and low latency (making the most of your time and network connection).

This ensures that minor fluctuations in run time or memory use will not result in your job being cancelled by the scheduler.

The time estimate we provided in the job script was far too long! This makes it harder for the queuing system to accurately estimate when resources will become free for other jobs. Practically, this means that the queuing system waits to dispatch our amdahl job until the full requested time slot opens, instead of “sneaking it in” a much shorter window where the job could actually finish. Specifying the expected runtime in the submission script more accurately will help alleviate cluster congestion and may get your job dispatched earlier.

If the machine runs out of memory or processing capacity, it will become very slow and unusable for everyone. While the machine is meant to be used, be sure to do so responsibly – in ways that will not adversely impact other users’ experience.  Login nodes are always the right place to launch jobs, but data transfers should be done on the Torch Data Transfer Nodes (gDTNs). Please see more about gDTNs at Data Transfers. Similarly, computationally intensive tasks should all be done on compute nodes. This refers to not just computational analysis/research tasks, but also to processor intensive software installations and similar tasks.  Login Nodes Are a Shared Resource Remember, the login node is shared with all other users and your actions could cause issues for other people. Think carefully about the potential implications of issuing commands that may use large amounts of resource. Unsure? Ask your friendly systems administrator (“sysadmin”) if the thing you’re contemplating is suitable for the login node, or if there’s another mechanism to get it done safely. Please email hpc@nyu.edu with questions.  You can always use the commands top and ps ux to list the processes that are running on the login node along with the amount of CPU and memory they are using. If this check reveals that the login node is somewhat idle, you can safely use it for your non-routine processing task. If something goes wrong – the process takes too long, or doesn’t respond – you can use the kill command along with the PID to terminate the process.  Login Node Etiquette Which of these commands would be a routine task to run on the login node? python physics_sim.pymakecreate_directories.shmolecular_dynamics_2tar -xzf R-3.3.0.tar.gz [Click for Solution] Solution Building software, creating directories, and unpacking software are common and acceptable tasks for the login node: options #2 (make), #3 (mkdir), and #5 (tar) are probably OK. note Script names do not always reflect their contents though, so before launching #3, please less create_directories.sh and make sure it’s not a Trojan horse. Running resource-intensive applications is frowned upon. Unless you are sure it will not affect other users, do not run jobs like #1 (python) or #4 (custom MD code). If you’re unsure, ask your friendly sysadmin for advice by emailing hpc@nyu.edu.  If you experience performance issues with a login node you should report it to the system staff by sending email to hpc@nyu.edu for them to investigate.

A simple mistake in a job script can end up costing a large amount of resource budget. Imagine a job script with a mistake that makes it sit doing nothing for 24 hours on 1000 cores or one where you have requested 2000 cores by mistake and only use 100 of them! This problem can be compounded when people write scripts that automate job submission (for example, when running the same calculation or analysis over lots of different parameters or files). When this happens it hurts both you (as you waste lots of charged resource) and other users (who are blocked from accessing the idle compute nodes). On very busy resources you may wait many days in a queue for your job to fail within 10 seconds of starting due to a trivial typo in the job script. This is extremely frustrating!  Test Job Submission Scripts That Use Large Amounts of Resources We suggest that you test a subset of you data or analysis on an interactive node prior to running full batch jobs. This way you can request a smaller set of resources and time which should decrease your wait time in the queue, and you'll be able to quickly iterate code refactoring in interactive mode. When you've got everything working well on smaller problems you can submit batch jobs for larger ones. Even after doing the above it's often wise to start with a small batch job first to make sure that you don't have any errors in your batch script.

Even if you are not writing your own programs, these can be very useful for storing job scripts, analysis scripts and small input files. This can provide a layer of redundant protection for some of your files.  While the Torch HPC system does offer some backups, it is important to understand which storage options are backed up and what the limitations of those backups are. Please see HPC Storage for details.  It is also important to remember that your access to the shared HPC system will generally be time-limited, so you should ensure you have a plan for transferring your data off the system before your access finishes. The time required to transfer large amounts of data should not be underestimated and you should ensure you have planned for this early enough (ideally, before you even start using the system for your research).  In all these cases, please contact hpc@nyu.edu if you have questions about data transfer and storage for the volumes of data you will be using.

When we are sitting at a computer (or standing, or holding it in our hands or on our wrists), we have come to expect a visual display with icons, widgets, and perhaps some windows or applications: a graphical user interface, or GUI. Since computer clusters are remote resources that we connect to over slow or intermittent interfaces (WiFi and VPNs especially), it is more practical to use a command-line interface, or CLI, to send commands as plain-text. If a command returns output, it is printed as plain text as well. The commands we run today will not open a window to show graphical results.  If you have ever opened the Windows Command Prompt or macOS Terminal, you have seen a CLI. This is the CLI on your local machine. The only leap to be made here is to open a CLI on a remote machine, while taking some precautions so that other folks on the network can’t see (or change) the commands you’re running or the results the remote machine sends back. We will use the Secure SHell protocol (or SSH) to open an encrypted network connection between two machines, allowing you to send &amp; receive text and data without having to worry about prying eyes.    SSH clients are usually command-line tools, where you provide the remote machine address as the only required argument. If your username on the remote system differs from what you use locally, you must provide that as well. If your SSH client has a graphical front-end, such as PuTTY or MobaXterm, you will set these arguments before clicking “connect.” From the terminal, you’ll write something like ssh userName@hostname, where the argument is just like an email address: the “@” symbol is used to separate the personal ID from the address of the remote machine.  When logging in to a laptop, tablet, or other personal device, a username, password, or pattern are normally required to prevent unauthorized access. In these situations, the likelihood of somebody else intercepting your password is low, since logging your keystrokes requires a malicious exploit or physical access. For systems like log-1 running an SSH server, anybody on the network can log in, or try to.

There are a variety of programs that can be used for this; a few common ones we describe here, as follows:  Git BASH​  Git BASH gives you a terminal like interface in Windows. You can use this to connect to a remote computer via SSH. It can be downloaded for free from Git for Windows.  Windows Subsystem for Linux​  The Windows Subsystem for Linux also allows you to connect to a remote computer via SSH. Please see the instructions from Microsoft.  MobaXterm​  MobaXterm is a terminal window emulator for Windows and the home edition can be downloaded for free from mobatek.net. If you follow the link you will note that there are two editions of the home version available: Portable and Installer. The portable edition puts all MobaXterm content in a folder on the desktop (or anywhere else you would like it) so that it is easy to add plug-ins or remove the software. The installer edition adds MobaXterm to your Windows installation and menu as any other program you might install. If you are not sure that you will continue to use MobaXterm in the future, the portable edition is likely the best choice for you.  If you use MobaXterm you can use MobaKeyGen to manage your ssh keys. Please see the MoabXterm documentation for details.  Download the version that you would like to use and install it as you would any other software on your Windows installation. Once the software is installed you can run it by either opening the folder installed with the portable edition and double-clicking on the executable file named MobaXterm_Personal_11.1 (your version number may vary) or, if the installer edition was used, finding the executable through either the start menu or the Windows search option.  Once the MobaXterm window is open you should see a large button in the middle of that window with the text “Start Local Terminal”. Click this button and you will have a terminal window at your disposal.  PuTTY​  It is strictly speaking not necessary to have a terminal running on your local computer in order to access and use a remote system, only a window into the remote system once connected. PuTTY is likely the oldest, most well-known, and widely used software solution to take this approach.  PuTTY is available for free download. Download the version that is correct for your operating system and install it as you would other software on your Windows system. Once installed it will be available through the start menu or similar.  Running PuTTY will not initially produce a terminal but instead a window full of connection options. Putting the address of the remote system in the “Host Name (or IP Address)” box and either pressing enter or clicking the “Open” button should begin the connection process.  If this works you will see a terminal window open that prompts you for a username through the “login as:” prompt and then for a password. If both of these are passed correctly then you will be given access to the system and will see a message saying so within the terminal. If you need to escape the authentication process you can hold the Control (Ctrl) key and press the c key to exit and start again.

SSH Agents on Linux, macOS, and Windows​  Open your terminal application and check if an agent is running:  [user@laptop ~]$ ssh-add -l   If you get an error like this one,  Error Error connecting to agent: No such file or directory  … then you need to launch the agent as follows:  [user@laptop ~]$ eval $(ssh-agent)   What’s in a $(...)? The syntax of this SSH Agent command is unusual, based on what we’ve seen in the UNIX Shell tutorial. This is because the ssh-agent command creates opens a connection that only you have access to, and prints a series of shell commands that can be used to reach it – but does not execute them! [user@laptop ~]$ ssh-agent SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-Zvvga2Y8kQZN/agent.131521; export SSH_AUTH_SOCK; SSH_AGENT_PID=131522; export SSH_AGENT_PID; echo Agent pid 131522; The eval command interprets this text output as commands and allows you to access the SSH Agent connection you just created. You could run each line of the ssh-agent output yourself, and achieve the same result. Using eval just makes this easier.  Otherwise, your agent is already running: don’t mess with it.

In this tutorial, we will connect to Torch — an HPC system located at New York University. Although it’s unlikely that every system will be exactly like Torch, it’s a very good example of what you can expect from an HPC installation. To connect to Torch we will use SSH (if you are using PuTTY see details above).  SSH allows us to connect to UNIX computers remotely, and use them as if they were our own.

However, we can chain these small UNIX commands together to perform otherwise complicated actions!  For our first foray into piping, or redirecting output, we are going to use the &gt; operator to write output to a file. When using &gt;, whatever is on the left of the &gt; is written to the filename you specify on the right of the arrow. The actual syntax looks like command &gt; filename.  Let’s try several basic usages of &gt;. echo simply prints back, or echoes, whatever you type after it.  $ echo &quot;this is a test&quot; this is a test $ echo &quot;this is a test&quot; &gt; test.txt $ ls bash-lesson.tar.gz fastq dmel-all-r6.19.gtf gene_association.fb dmel_unique_protein_isoforms_fb_2016_01.tsv test.txt $ cat test.txt this is a test   Awesome, let’s try that with a more complicated command, like wc -l.  $ wc -l * &gt; word_counts.txt wc: fastq: Is a directory $ cat word_counts.txt 53037 bash-lesson.tar.gz 542048 dmel-all-r6.19.gtf 22129 dmel_unique_protein_isoforms_fb_2016_01.tsv 106290 gene_association.fb 1 test.txt 723505 total   Notice how we still got some output to the console even though we “piped” the output to a file? Our expected output still went to the file, but how did the error message get skipped and not go to the file?  This phenomena is an artefact of how UNIX systems are built. There are 3 input/output streams for every UNIX program you will run: stdin, stdout, and stderr.  Let’s dissect these three streams of input/output in the command we just ran: wc -l * &gt; word_counts.txt  stdin is the input to a program. In the command we just ran, stdin is represented by *, which is simply every filename in our current directory.stdout contains the actual, expected output. In this case, &gt; redirected stdout to the file word_counts.txt.stderr typically contains error messages and other information that doesn’t quite fit into the category of “output”. If we insist on redirecting both stdout and stderr to the same file we would use &amp;&gt; instead of &gt;. (We can redirect just stderr using 2&gt;.)  Knowing what we know now, let’s try re-running the command, and send all of the output (including the error message) to the same word_counts.txt files as before.  $ wc -l * &amp;&gt; word_counts.txt   Notice how there was no output to the console that time. Let’s check that the error message went to the file like we specified.  $ cat word_counts.txt 53037 bash-lesson.tar.gz 542048 dmel-all-r6.19.gtf 22129 dmel_unique_protein_isoforms_fb_2016_01.tsv wc: fastq: Is a directory 106290 gene_association.fb 1 test.txt 7 word_counts.txt 723512 total   Success! The wc: fastq: Is a directory error message was written to the file. Also, note how the file was silently overwritten by directing output to the same place as before. Sometimes this is not the behaviour we want. How do we append (add) to a file instead of overwriting it?  Appending to a file is done the same was as redirecting output. However, instead of &gt;, we will use &gt;&gt;.  $ echo &quot;We want to add this sentence to the end of our file&quot; &gt;&gt; word_counts.txt $ cat word_counts.txt 22129 dmel_unique_protein_isoforms_fb_2016_01.tsv 471308 Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP5.77.gtf 0 fastq 1304914 fb_synonym_fb_2016_01.tsv 106290 gene_association.fb 1 test.txt 1904642 total We want to add this sentence to the end of our file   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Chaining commands together​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Wildcards and Pipes","url":"/docs/hpc/tutorial_intro_shell_hpc/wildcards_pipes/#chaining-commands-together","content":" We now know how to redirect stdout and stderr to files. We can actually take this a step further and redirect output (stdout) from one command to serve as the input (stdin) for the next. To do this, we use the | (pipe) operator.  grep is an extremely useful command. It finds things for us within files. Basic usage (there are a lot of options for more clever things, see the man page) uses the syntax grep whatToFind fileToSearch. Let’s use grep to find all of the entries pertaining to the Act5C gene in Drosophila melanogaster.  $ grep Act5C dmel-all-r6.19.gtf   The output is nearly unintelligible since there is so much of it. Let’s send the output of that grep command to head so we can just take a peek at the first line.

We can do the same trick to send grep’s output to wc -l:  $ grep Act5C dmel-all-r6.19.gtf | wc -l 46   note This is just the same as redirecting output to a file, then reading the number of lines from that file.

[Click for Solution] Solution ls fastq/ | wc -l Output of ls is one line per item, when chaining commands together like this, so counting lines gives the number of files.  Reading from compressed files Let’s compress one of our files using gzip. $ gzip gene_association.fb zcat acts like cat, except that it can read information from .gz (compressed) files. Using zcat, can you write a command to take a look at the top few lines of the gene_association.fb.gz file (without decompressing the file itself)? [Click for Solution] Solution zcat gene_association.fb.gz | head or for Mac: zcat &lt; gene_association.fb.gz | head zcat works a little differently on Macs. You'll need to use &lt; to explicitly input the file for zcat. The head command without any options shows the first 10 lines of a file.

Right now, all we see is something that looks like this:  [NetID@login-1 ~]$   The dollar sign is a prompt, which shows us that the shell is waiting for input; your shell may use a different character as a prompt and may add information before the prompt. When typing commands, either from these lessons or from other sources, do not type the prompt, only the commands that follow it.  Type the command whoami, then press the Enter key (sometimes marked Return) to send the command to the shell. The command’s output is the ID of the current user, i.e., it shows us who the shell thinks we are:  $ whoami &lt;NetID&gt;   More specifically, when we type whoami in the shell:  finds a program called whoami,runs that program,displays that program’s output, thendisplays a new prompt to tell us that it’s ready for more commands.  Next, let’s find out where we are by running a command called pwd (which stands for “print working directory”). (“Directory” is another word for “folder”). At any moment, our current working directory (where we are) is the directory that the computer assumes we want to run commands in unless we explicitly specify something else. Here, the computer’s response is /home/&lt;NetID&gt;, which is &lt;NetID&gt;'s home directory. Note that the location of your home directory may differ from system to system.  $ pwd /home/&lt;NetID&gt;   So, we know where we are. How do we look and see what’s in our current directory?  $ ls   ls prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory in alphabetical order, arranged neatly into columns.  Differences between remote and local system Open a second terminal window on your local computer and run the ls command without logging in remotely. What differences do you see? [click to see the solution] SolutionYou probably see something like this: Output Application Documents Library Music Public Desktop Downloads Movies Pictures In addition you should also note that the preamble before the prompt ($) is different. This is very important for making sure you know what system you are issuing commands on when in the shell.  If nothing shows up when you run ls, it means that nothing’s there. Let’s make a directory for us to play with.  mkdir &lt;new directory name&gt; makes a new directory with that name in your current location. Notice that this command required two pieces of input: the actual name of the command (mkdir) and an argument that specifies the name of the directory you wish to create.  $ mkdir documents   Let’s ls again. What do we see?  Our folder is there, awesome. What if we wanted to go inside it and do stuff there? We will use the cd (change directory) command to move around. Let’s cd into our new documents folder.  $ cd documents $ pwd ~/documents   What is the ~ character? When using the shell, ~ is a shortcut that represents /home/&lt;NetID&gt;.  Now that we know how to use cd, we can go anywhere. That’s a lot of responsibility. What happens if we get “lost” and want to get back to where we started?  To go back to your home directory, the following three commands will work:  $ cd /home/&lt;NetID&gt; $ cd ~ $ cd   A quick note on the structure of a UNIX (Linux/Mac/Android/Solaris/etc) filesystem. Directories and absolute paths (i.e. exact position in the system) are always prefixed with a /. / by itself is the “root” or base directory.  Let’s go there now, look around, and then return to our home directory.  $ cd / $ ls $ cd ~ bin dev initrd local mnt proc root scratch tmp work boot etc lib localscratch nix project run srv usr cvmfs home lib64 media opt ram sbin sys var   The “home” directory is the one where we generally want to keep all of our files. Other folders on a UNIX OS contain system files, and get modified and changed as you install new software or upgrade your OS.  There are several other useful shortcuts you should be aware of.  . represents your current directory.. represents the “parent” directory of your current locationWhile typing nearly anything, you can have bash try to autocomplete what you are typing by pressing the tab key.  Let’s try these out now:  $ cd ./documents $ pwd $ cd .. $ pwd /home/&lt;NetID&gt;/documents /home/&lt;NetID&gt;   Many commands also have multiple behaviours that you can invoke with command line ‘flags.’ What is a flag? It’s generally just your command followed by a - and the name of the flag (sometimes it’s – followed by the name of the flag). You follow the flag(s) with any additional arguments you might need.  We’re going to demonstrate a couple of these “flags” using ls.  Show hidden files with -a. Hidden files are files that begin with ., these files will not appear otherwise, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t there! “Hidden” files are not hidden for security purposes, they are usually just config files and other tempfiles that the user doesn’t necessarily need to see all the time.  $ ls -a . .. .bash_logout .bash_profile .bashrc documents .emacs .mozilla .ssh   Notice how both . and .. are visible as hidden files. Show files, their size in bytes, date last modified, permissions, and other things with -l.  $ ls -l drwxr-xr-x 2 &lt;NetID&gt; tc001 4096 Jan 14 17:31 documents   This is a lot of information to take in at once and we will explain it all later! ls -l is extremely useful, and tells you almost everything you need to know about your files without actually looking at them.  We can also use multiple flags at the same time!  $ ls -l -a [yourUsername@gra-login1 ~]$ ls -la total 36 drwx--S--- 5 &lt;NetID&gt; tc001 4096 Nov 28 09:58 . drwxr-x--- 3 root tc001 4096 Nov 28 09:40 .. -rw-r--r-- 1 &lt;NetID&gt; tc001 18 Dec 6 2016 .bash_logout -rw-r--r-- 1 &lt;NetID&gt; tc001 193 Dec 6 2016 .bash_profile -rw-r--r-- 1 &lt;NetID&gt; tc001 231 Dec 6 2016 .bashrc drwxr-sr-x 2 &lt;NetID&gt; tc001 4096 Nov 28 09:58 documents -rw-r--r-- 1 &lt;NetID&gt; tc001 334 Mar 3 2017 .emacs drwxr-xr-x 4 &lt;NetID&gt; tc001 4096 Aug 2 2016 .mozilla drwx--S--- 2 &lt;NetID&gt; tc001 4096 Nov 28 09:58 .ssh   Flags generally precede any arguments passed to a UNIX command. ls actually takes an extra argument that specifies a directory to look into. When you use flags and arguments together, the syntax (how it’s supposed to be typed) generally looks something like this:  $ command &lt;flags/options&gt; &lt;arguments&gt;   So using ls -l -a on a different directory than the one we’re in would look something like:  $ ls -l -a ~/documents drwxr-sr-x 2 &lt;NetID&gt; tc001 4096 Nov 28 09:58 . drwx--S--- 5 &lt;NetID&gt; tc001 4096 Nov 28 09:58 ..

Exploring More ls Arguments What does the command ls do when used with the -l and -h arguments? Some of its output is about properties that we do not cover in this lesson (such as file permissions and ownership), but the rest should be useful nevertheless. [Click for Solution] Solution The -l arguments makes ls use a long listing format, showing not only the file/directory names but also additional information such as the file size and the time of its last modification. The -h argument makes the file size “human readable”, i.e. display something like 5.3K instead of 5369.  Listing Recursively and by Time The command ls -R lists the contents of directories recursively, i.e., lists their sub-directories, sub-sub-directories, and so on in alphabetical order at each level.

It turns out we can do this with a text editor. Start editing a file called demo.sh (to recap, we can do this with nano demo.sh). The .sh is the standard file extension for shell scripts that most people use (you may also see .bash used).  Our shell script will have two parts:  On the very first line, add #!/bin/bash. The #! (pronounced “hash-bang”) tells our computer what program to run our script with. In this case, we are telling it to run our script with our command-line shell (what we’ve been doing everything in so far). If we wanted our script to be run with something else, like Perl, we could use #!/usr/bin/perl instead.Now, anywhere below the first line, add echo &quot;Our script worked!&quot;.

Variables are a great way of saving information under a name you can access later. In programming languages like Python and R, variables can store pretty much anything you can think of. In the shell, they usually just store text. The best way to understand how they work is to see them in action.  To set a variable, simply type in a name containing only letters, numbers, and underscores, followed by an = and whatever you want to put in the variable. Shell variable names are often uppercase by convention (but do not have to be).  $ VAR=&quot;This is our variable&quot;   To use a variable, prefix its name with a $ sign. Note that if we want to simply check what a variable is, we should use echo (or else the shell will try to run the contents of a variable).  $ echo $VAR This is our variable   Let’s try setting a variable in our script and then recalling its value as part of a command. We’re going to make it so our script runs wc -l on whichever file we specify with FILE.  Our script:  #!/bin/bash # set our variable to the name of our GTF file FILE=dmel-all-r6.19.gtf # call wc -l on our file wc -l $FILE   $ ./demo.sh 542048 dmel-all-r6.19.gtf   What if we wanted to do our little wc -l script on other files without having to change $FILE every time we want to use it? There is actually a special shell variable we can use in scripts that allows us to use arguments in our scripts (arguments are extra information that we can pass to our script, like the -l in wc -l).  To use the first argument to a script, use $1 (the second argument is $2, and so on). Let’s change our script to run wc -l on $1 instead of $FILE. Note that we can also pass all of the arguments using $@ (not going to use it in this lesson, but it’s something to be aware of).  Our script:  #!/bin/bash # call wc -l on our first argument wc -l $1   $ ./demo.sh dmel_unique_protein_isoforms_fb_2016_01.tsv 22129 dmel_unique_protein_isoforms_fb_2016_01.tsv   Nice!

This will let us do the same string of commands on every file in a directory (or other stuff of that nature).  for-loops generally have the following syntax:  #!/bin/bash for VAR in first second third do echo $VAR done   When a for-loop gets run, the loop will run once for everything following the word in. In each iteration, the variable $VAR is set to a particular value for that iteration. In this case it will be set to first during the first iteration, second on the second, and so on. During each iteration, the code between do and done is performed.  Let’s run the script we just wrote (I saved mine as loop.sh).  $ chmod +x loop.sh $ ./loop.sh first second third   What if we wanted to loop over a shell variable, such as every file in the current directory?

[Click for Solution] Solution Create the following script in a file called head_all.sh #!/bin/bash for FILE in *.fasatq do echo $FILE head -n 4 $FILE done The for line could be modified to be for FILE in *_1.fastq to achieve the second aim.  Concatenating variables Concatenating (i.e. mashing together) variables is quite easy to do. Add whatever you want to concatenate to the beginning or end of the shell variable after enclosing it in {} characters. $ FILE=stuff.txt $ echo ${FILE}.example stuff.txt.example Can you write a script that prints off the name of every file in a directory with .processed added to it? [Click for Solution] Solution Create the following script in a file called process.sh: #!/bin/bash for FILE in * do echo ${FILE}.processed done note This will also print directories appended with .processed. To truly only get files and not directories, we need to modify this to use the find command to give us only files in the current directory: #!/bin/bash for FILE in $(find . -maxdepth 1 -type f) do echo ${FILE}.processed done but this will have the side effect of listing hidden files too. We can fix this by making a small change to the find command: #!/bin/bash for FILE in $(find . -maxdepth 1 -type f ! -name &quot;.*&quot;) do echo ${FILE}.processed done We've added ! -name &quot;.*&quot; to the find command. It means not (!) a name that starts with .. As you can see, programming is often iterative in more ways than one.   Special permissions What if we want to give different sets of users different permissions. chmod actually accepts special numeric codes instead of stuff like chmod +x, as we mentioned above. Again, the numeric codes are as follows: read = 4, write = 2, execute = 1. For each user we will assign permissions based on the sum of these permissions (must be between 7 and 0).

Text is one of the simplest computer file formats, defined as a simple sequence of text lines.  What if we want to make a file? There are a few ways of doing this, the easiest of which is simply using a text editor. For this lesson, we are going to use nano, since it’s more intuitive than many other terminal text editors.

Let’s make a new file now, type whatever you want in it, and save it.  $ nano draft.txt     Nano defines a number of shortcut keys (prefixed by the Control or Ctrl key) to perform actions such as saving the file or exiting the editor. Here are the shortcut keys for a few common actions:  Ctrl+O — save the file (into a current name or a new name).Ctrl+X — exit the editor. If you have not saved your file upon exiting, nano will ask you if you want to save.Ctrl+K — cut (“kill”) a text line. This command deletes a line and saves it on a clipboard. If repeated multiple times without any interruption (key typing or cursor movement), it will cut a chunk of text lines.Ctrl+U — paste the cut text line (or lines). This command can be repeated to paste the same text elsewhere.  Option\tExplanationCtrl + O\tSave the changes Ctrl + X\tExit nano Ctrl + K\tCut single line Ctrl + U\tPaste the text  Using vim as a text editor From time to time, you may encounter the vim text editor. Although vim isn’t the easiest or most user-friendly of text editors, you’ll be able to find it on any system and it has many more features than nano. vim has several modes, a “command” mode (for doing big operations, like saving and quitting) and an “insert” mode. You can switch to insert mode with the i key, and command mode with Esc. In insert mode, you can type more or less normally. In command mode there are a few commands you should be aware of: :q! — quit, without saving:wq — save and quitdd — cut/delete a liney — paste a line  Do a quick check to confirm our file was created.  $ ls draft.txt   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Reading Files​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Writing and Reading Files","url":"/docs/hpc/tutorial_intro_shell_hpc/writing_reading_files/#reading-files","content":" Let’s read the file we just created now.

How do we go about changing it? It turns out that mv is also used to rename files and directories.

The syntax is quite similar to moving files: mv oldName newName  $ mv draft.txt newname.testfile $ ls newname.testfile   File extensions are arbitrary In the last example, we changed both a file’s name and extension at the same time. On UNIX systems, file extensions (like .txt) are arbitrary. A file is a .txt file only because we say it is. Changing the name or extension of the file will never change a file’s contents, so you are free to rename things as you wish. With that in mind, however, file extensions are a useful tool for keeping track of what type of data it contains. A .txt file typically contains text, for instance.  Copying — What if we want to copy a file, instead of simply renaming or moving it? Use cp command (an abbreviated name for “copy”). This command has two different uses that work in the same way as mv:  Copy to same directory (copied file is renamed): cp file newFilenameCopy to other directory (copied file retains original name): cp file directory  You can also combine these two operations in one command to copy a file to a different directory with a new name: cp file directory/newFilename  Command\tExplanationcp test_file1.txt test_file2.txt\tCopies a duplicate copy of test_file1.txt with the new name test_file2.txt cp -r subdir subdir2\tRecursively copies the directory “subdir” to a new directory “subdir2”.

Once a file is deleted, it is gone, never to return. So be very careful when deleting files.  Files are deleted with rm file [moreFiles]. To delete the newname.testfile in our current directory:  $ ls files documents newname.testfile $ rm newname.testfile $ ls files documents   That was simple enough.

As it turns out, rmdir is unable to remove directories that have stuff in them. To delete a directory and everything inside it, we will use a special variant of rm, rm -rf directory. This is probably the scariest command on UNIX- it will force delete a directory and all of its contents without prompting. ALWAYS double check your typing before using it… if you leave out the arguments, it will attempt to delete everything on your file system that you have permission to delete. So when deleting directories be very, very careful.  What happens when you use rm -rf accidentally Steam is a major online sales platform for PC video games with over 125 million users. Despite this, it hasn’t always had the most stable or error-free code. In January 2015, user kevyin on GitHub reported that Steam’s Linux client had deleted every file on his computer. It turned out that one of the Steam programmers had added the following line: rm -rf &quot;$STEAMROOT/&quot;*. Due to the way that Steam was set up, the variable $STEAMROOT was never initialized, meaning the statement evaluated to rm -rf /*. This coding error in the Linux client meant that Steam deleted every single file on a computer when run in certain scenarios (including connected external hard drives).

To extract the files from a .tar.gz file, we run the command tar -xvf filename.tar.gz:  $ tar -xvf bash-lesson.tar.gz dmel-all-r6.19.gtf dmel_unique_protein_isoforms_fb_2016_01.tsv gene_association.fb SRR307023_1.fastq SRR307023_2.fastq SRR307024_1.fastq SRR307024_2.fastq SRR307025_1.fastq SRR307025_2.fastq SRR307026_1.fastq SRR307026_2.fastq SRR307027_1.fastq SRR307027_2.fastq SRR307028_1.fastq SRR307028_2.fastq SRR307029_1.fastq SRR307029_2.fastq SRR307030_1.fastq SRR307030_2.fastq   Unzipping files We just unzipped a .tar.gz file for this example. What if we run into other file formats that we need to unzip? Just use the handy reference below: gunzip extracts the contents of .gz filesunzip extracts the contents of .zip filestar -xvf extracts the contents of .tar.gz, .tgz and .tar.bz2 files  That is a lot of files! One of these files, dmel-all-r6.19.gtf is extremely large, and contains every annotated feature in the Drosophila melanogaster genome. It’s a huge file. What happens if we run cat on it? (Press Ctrl + C to stop it).  So, cat is a really bad option when reading big files… it scrolls through the entire file far too quickly! What are the alternatives? Try all of these out and see which ones you like best!  head file: Print the top 10 lines in a file to the console. You can control the number of lines you see with the -n numberOfLines flag.tail file: Same as head, but prints the last 10 lines in a file to the console.less file: Opens a file and display as much as possible on-screen. You can scroll with Enter or the arrow keys on your keyboard. Press q to close the viewer.  Out of cat, head, tail, and less, which method of reading files is your favourite? Why?  Key Points Use nano to create or edit text files from a terminal.Use cat file1 [file2 ...] to print the contents of one or more files to the terminal.Use mv old dir to move a file or directory old to another directory dir.Use mv old new to rename a file or directory old to a new name.Use cp old new to copy a file under a new name or location.Use cp old dir copies a file old into a directory dir.Use rm old to delete (remove) a file.File extensions are entirely arbitrary on UNIX systems.
