The shell is a program with the special role of having the job of running other programs rather than doing calculations or similar tasks itself. What the user types goes into the shell, which then figures out what commands to run and orders the computer to execute them. (Note that the shell is called \u201Cthe shell\u201D because it encloses the operating system in order to hide some of its complexity and make it simpler to interact with.) The most popular Unix shell is Bash, the Bourne Again SHell (so-called because it\u2019s derived from a shell written by Stephen Bourne).

In the earliest days of computers, the only way to interact with early computers was to rewire them. From the 1950s to the 1980s most people used line printers. These devices only allowed input and output of the letters, numbers, and punctuation found on a standard keyboard, so programming languages and software interfaces had to be designed around that constraint and text-based interfaces were the way to do this. A typing-based interface is often called a command-line interface, or CLI, to distinguish it from a graphical user interface, or GUI, which most people now use. The heart of a CLI is a read-evaluate-print loop, or REPL: when the user types a command and then presses the Enter (or Return) key, the computer reads it, executes it, and prints its output. The user then types another command, and so on until the user logs off."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Learning to use Bash or any other shell sometimes feels more like programming than like using a mouse.
